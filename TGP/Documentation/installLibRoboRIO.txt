Hi Richard,

I'm attaching the latest library version of the LabVIEW code. You shouldn't need the original code at this point, with the exception of the "tuning/ID" panel code - we'll be replacing that shortly.

The .so file needs to be dropped into the file structure of the RoboRIO, similar to what happens on the back end of the other vendors'
"installers". FTP into to the RIO, then drop the file here:
ftp://10.XX.XX.2/usr/local/frc/third-party/lib/
I don't think you need any additional files to be installed with this, assuming all of the FRC updates have been installed/run.

Let me know if you run into any issues and we'll get it figured out. I can send you screenshots of my working program for reference, if that'd be helpful. I have a 6-Venom drive base with a spare motor for profiling work.

Thanks,
Justin
